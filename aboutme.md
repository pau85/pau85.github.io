Hello! I'm Paulette Melchiori and I built this website in using the Jekyll framework. I started this website in May of 2024 which was roughly 5 months into switching tech stacks from Mainframe to Web Development with React-Redux, Node and TypeScript. While I had taken many courses in Web Development in college at UW-Whitewater, I still had a lot to catch back up on. It was a happy return, and ever since I have been exploring more and more frameworks and tools to use while developing. 

Also I have a passion for animation, programming and writing. In my experience to stay on top of tech, it requires a routine of study and project work outside of work. I really enjoy combining my hobby of animation with programming as a combined hobby. It gives me a chance to try out some new tech and also make it really fun with animation and art. 

Feel free to leave comments or feedback on any of my projects listed. I am always open to learning new things and appreciate any constructive feedback given.

When I'm not coding, watching/creating animations, or writing, I'm a proud mom of 2 geriatric cats, Butters (14) and Margie (13) and have a wonderful husband, Aaron. Aaron and I love to go to concerts, camp and travel across the country when we aren't hanging out with our cats watching tv shows.

So, whether you're here for the tech insights, the animation discussions or the occasional cat story, welcome!
