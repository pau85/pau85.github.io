## Hello again!

Thanks for visiting my website and my blog! I am officially keeping a blog on my website to talk about my life in tech (the positive and fun stuff of course) and what kind of projects I am working on. 

Last time I talked about few different projects. 

- C# Foundational Certification  (C#)
- Unity Animation Project (C# and Unity 2D animation)
- Cat Food and Needs Portal (android app)
- Seeking Mavis Beacon (tech documentary)
- Wicked (amazing)
- Side Hobby Projects - Making a quilt still right now. I have been sore so I haven't worked on it, but about to pick it back up again shortly. I'll share pictures once it is done!!

feedback-app
In progress of getting my feedback-app page up and running. Soon visitors can leave feedback here. There's a weird page there right now, but I am going to be fixing that hopefully tonight. I'll post an update here again once its ready.

Thats it for now. I will be back again to give more updates. 

Talk to you later!
Paulette
