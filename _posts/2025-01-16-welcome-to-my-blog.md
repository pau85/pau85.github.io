## Hello there!

Thanks for visiting my website and my blog! I am officially keeping a blog on my website to talk about my life in tech (the positive and fun stuff of course) and what kind of projects I am working on. 

Right now I am working on few different projects. I started getting into C# with .NET and Unity recently, which has been really amazing so far. 

C# Foundational Certification
I completed a C# Foundational Certification through Microsoft just this past month through freecodecamp.org and in my opinion it was an amazing course to take. I highly recommend it if you are interested in C# and getting familiar with the basics of programming. If you know Java, it will most likely be pretty easy for you. I was rusty in Java when I took it (I have been working in Web Development with React and TypeScript lately), but recognized quite a bit still from Java which made me feel pretty confident in learning it throughout. Otherwise as a beginner, I think the course is still very good to get started in programming. It goes through a ton of good foundational programming topics, and about how to use VSCode. It's a really great well rounded course overall. 

Unity Animation Project
In Unity, I completed some training to start doing 2D and 3D animation. I think I want to stay with 2D animation because its what I have been doing for so long now. I have built up a lot of 2D art of my cats. However, 3D animation is really tempting for small games I think though. I have a few ideas for that, potentially just some fun sorting game or a cat character that maybe I can present on my website. I really love sorting games myself which I think makes it a perfect project to work on.

Cat Food and Needs Portal
Now this is super new - I just started working in Android Studio to build an android mobile app for cat food and accessories. I have had some brief exposure to Android development with Arduino through my internship with Meeper Technology. However, this was over 10 years ago, and so I wanted to refresh myself on Android development again. So I have started building that and now that I am writing this, I realized that I should really push that up to Github, I will do that. Just don't expect much, I am going to try to include images of my programs running at least. I will do that with this Android project. Just so you can see where I am at with it. I am looking into using certain frameworks to get used to the layout design and then I want to build the backend.

Seeking Mavis Beacon
Okay, I am a 90's kid and I had to watch this documentary because what kid didn't wind up using Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing to learn typing? It was a really cool documentary to watch and the ending is thought provoking. Its a story about digital media and really how we all started consuming it far earlier than with mobile phones. 

Okay - Wicked was pretty amazing
I want to start off by saying I am a pretty harsh critic of musicals that are made into movies. It usually doesn't meet my expectations, I am a snob, I know. I saw Wicked in Chicago in 2008 with my family. It was an amazing show to see and we had some really awesome balcony seats. That was a while ago though and I had forgotten the story. I begrudgely bought it for $29.99 on Amazon because the Spotify playlist convinced me to watch it if not for the acting then for the singing because it was awesome. Then I watched the movie and was even more blown away by the acting and music. It's one to checkout if you like musicals.

Side Hobby Projects
Making a quilt right now - its going well but I am super sore so I am doing dev projects now like this blog to rest my arms.

So thats it for now I think. I will be back again to give more updates. 

Talk to you later!
