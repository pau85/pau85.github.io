Welcome to my website! Its my vessel to show of all of my projects, whether it be programming or animation projects. Please feel free to connect with my on LinkedIn if you want to leave some feedback or just chat or network - I am down for connecting with others in the tech space. 

Other Projects in the works currently:
I also have a project started with Raspberry Pi. I plan to start a new section on this once I have something written up for it. So far I have my Raspberry Pi hooked up with my network and I am able to remote into it through Putty. A while back I did some internship work with Arduino boards and Java, so I am really excited to see what I can do with the Raspberry Pi.
